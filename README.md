A minimalist Python CLI tool to bulk delete your own messages in Discord channels or DMs.

## What it does
* **Auto-Filter**: Only deletes messages sent by you.
* **Session Manager**: Saves tokens locally so you don't have to re-enter them.
* **Deep Scan**: Searches through your entire message history.
